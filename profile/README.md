**Hi there!**

We're Rainy Productions, an organization aiming to work hard to build cool projects for our whole ecosystem.

Each of our members has an ambition to spare no effort to challenge ourselves and develop wonderful software, for the purpose of making the community a better place for everyone.
Rainy Productions is co-founded by [St7530](https://github.com/St7530) and some other members (who don't want their names leaked). It is now operated and managed by all. We currently don't have the intention to recruit new members. However, you can still get in touch with us through our official website and our contact email.

As a non-profit group of tech enthusiasts, we'd appreciate it a lot if you could offer a donation to us, for that will keep us motivated!
